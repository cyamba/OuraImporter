# OuraImporter
An import tool for your Oura ring data.
A client application that should be used for personal use to analyse you sleeping data further.
It downloads your data and stores it in a database locally. 
You can then analyse this data locally with any tools you see fit.
The application does not propagate personal data outside the scope of local usage, thus privacy of data is at the users own control and responsibility.
